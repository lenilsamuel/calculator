# Calculator Project

This is a basic calculator building to practice my HTML, CSS, JS and jQuery front-end skills.

- The calculator supports basic addition, subtraction, multiplication and division
- The calculator also supports keyboard input
- The app uses responsive design. Screen widths below 768px render the mobile view as shown below. Screen widths above 768px render the tablet view instead
